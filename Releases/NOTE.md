# Note:

.venv_builder can only be run on windows via powershell

need to generate a new .venv_builder every time you do it, it cannot be copied from a linux host

copy entire program folder to workingfile, then in powershell activate .venv_builder, then go to tax_matrix folder and run:
pyinstaller main.py

then rename main.exe and package all of it into a zip file
